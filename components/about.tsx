        <p>
          As a Computer Science Engineering student at BML Munjal University (class of 2025), I'm driven by a passion for innovative technology and a curiosity that fuels continuous learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach to software development is twofold:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Learning through Building:</strong> I dive into new technologies by creating projects that challenge me to apply and master new concepts.</li>
          <li><strong>Curiosity-Driven Development:</strong> When intrigued by how a product works, I challenge myself to build my own version, unraveling its complexities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Specializing in full-stack web and mobile development, I've built a diverse portfolio ranging from responsive web applications to cross-platform mobile apps. My projects showcase a blend of front-end finesse and back-end robustness, always pushing the boundaries of what's possible in modern software development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, you'll find me exploring emerging web and mobile technologies, contributing to open-source projects, collaborating with fellow developers on complex full-stack challenges, or enjoying a game of Valorant.
